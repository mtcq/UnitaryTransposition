%Input: matrix X, vector DIM with all the local dimensions oredered as [input1 output1 input2 output2 ... ]
%Output: matrix C inside the linear space spanned by Choi operators of NS quantum channels

%Requires: TR.m from mtcq

function C=ProjNSchannel(X, DIM)
k=max(size(DIM))/2;
C=X;
for i=1:k
    C=C+TR(C,[2*i-1,2*i],DIM)-TR(C,[2*i],DIM);
end

end
