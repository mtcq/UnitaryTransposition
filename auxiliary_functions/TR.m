%Function that implements the trace and replace map, that is, traces out the systems described in positions and replace it by
% normalised identity operators.
%For instance, the trace and replace in position l is given by _l X = tr_l(X) \otimes eye(l)_l/dim(l)

%Input: matrix X, positions to be traced, vector DIM with all the local dimensions
%Output: matrix out

%Requirements: PermuteSystems.m from QETLAB

% This .m file includes a modified version of PartialTrace.m from QETLAB.
% In this modified version, we can evaluate the partial trace of symbolic variables
% For that, we have changed the line which had the if contion "if(isnum)" to "if(isnum) || isa(X,'sym')"

%We now have the modified PARTIALTRACE function from QETLAB

%  PARTIALTRACE    Computes the partial trace of a matrix
%   This function has one required argument:
%     X: a square matrix
%
%   XPT = PartialTrace(X) is the partial transpose of the matrix X,
%   where it is assumed that length(X) is a perfect squares and both
%   subsystems have equal dimension. The trace is taken over the second
%   subsystem.
%
%   This function has three optional arguments:
%     SYS (default 2)
%     DIM (default has all subsystems of equal dimension)
%     MODE (default -1)
%
%   XPT = PartialTrace(X,SYS,DIM,MODE) gives the partial trace of the matrix X,
%   where the dimensions of the (possibly more than 2) subsystems are given
%   by the vector DIM and the subsystems to take the trace on are given by
%   the scalar or vector SYS. MODE is a flag that determines which of two
%   algorithms is used to compute the partial trace. If MODE = -1 then this
%   script chooses whichever algorithm it thinks will be faster based on
%   the dimensions of the subsystems being traced out and the sparsity of
%   X. If you wish to force one specific algorithm, set either MODE = 0
%   (which generally works best for full or non-numeric matrices, or sparse
%   matrices when most of the subsystems are being traced out) or MODE = 1
%   (which generally works best when X is large and sparse, and the partial
%   trace of X will also be large).
